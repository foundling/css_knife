```bash 
CSS Alphabetizer (work in progress)
 
usage: cssort [ -f css_file ] [ -o output_file]
purpose: sorts your css blocks alphabetically

todo: implement as a web service
todo: sort property blocks
todo: add minifier
todo: keep a count of '{' and '}'s so you can treat nested tags (.e.g. media query style rules) as a separate group if needed.
```
